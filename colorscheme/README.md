# My Custom Color Scheme

This directory contains the assets and scripts used to synchronize my custom color scheme across
all the tools I'm using.

## Desired properties

The colorscheme must be:
* Portable (work on different systems, different terminals, etc),
* Accessible (use colors and contrasts that are suited for color blindness, for example)
* Warm (as much as possible, use colors that are warmer to reduce eye strain)
* Consistent (the colors should be reused across the tools I'm using, as much as possible)
